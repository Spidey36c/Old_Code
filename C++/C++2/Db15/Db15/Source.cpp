*
* General Instructions: Complete each step before proceeding to the
* next.
*
* 1) Look at the existing code and identify how many
*    times you anticipate that the constructor will be called
*    when the program is executed.
* 2) Add an informative output message in the constructor
*    that includes the name of the stock symbol.
* 3) Build and execute the program and verify that the
*    constructor was called once for each of the three
*    objects created.
* 4) Add a destructor.
* 5) Set and run your program to Breakpoint 1. Use Step
*    Into to actually step into the destructor.
* 6) Stop debugging.
* 7) Add an informative message in your destructor that
*    includes the name of the stock symbol.
* 8) Rebuild and execute the program. Make sure
*    the dtor is being called for all three of
*    your Stock objects.
* 9) If you have not already done so, find and correct
*    the problem associated with the destructor not
*    being called for one of your objects.
*10) Create an array of three Stock objects in main.
*11) Rebuild and execute the program. Notice we have a
*    problem.
*12) Add the necessary constructor to fix this problem.
*    Make sure you include a descriptive message noting
*    that this is the default constructor. Rebuild and
*    execute the program to make sure that everything is
*    working.
*13) Notice the number of times the constructors and the
*    destructor are being called.
*14) Try making both of your constructors private.
*15) Rebuild and execute the program. Notice how this stops
*    any instance of the object from being created.
*16) Make your constructors public again.
*17) Uncomment the following two lines in main:
*      // Stock s1();
*      // s1.setPrice( 12.34 );
*18) Try rebuilding the program. Notice there is a problem.
*19) Look carefully at the first line you uncommented.
*    This is simply a function declaration. It is not
*    instantiating an object!
*20) Remove the ( ), rebuild and execute the program.
