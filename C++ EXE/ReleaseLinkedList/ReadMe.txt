This program takes a lot more user input. It is a linked list of song names and their artist
First of all no change needs to be made to Current as that can be done inside the program.
if you want to change the text files, to avoid breaking the program you must enter songs in the format
Song Name
Artist Name
Changing ToBeAdded.txt affects the batch add selection. Any time batch add is used, any text in ToBeAdded.txt is put into the linked list.
Changing ToBeAdded.txt affects the batch remove selection. Once batch remove is used any song that is in both the linked list and the text file will be deleted from the linked list.
