No real change is needed for the program to run, as this program was more of a proof of concept to use structs.
However if you do want new output, you can change Data.txt by changing one or more person in the format 
(FirstName LastName Social-Security(but you could use phone numbers, but they must be in the format xxx-xxx-xxxx but the it will still output it as a social security number) Wage Hours Part-Time/Full-Time(indicated as P and F respectivly))
You can not add anymore names to the list as it will cause memory leaks.
